Also, we created 3 customer journey maps. Besides, we researched and found 26 services that 1/3 fitness could implement against Covid19 but after prioritization and discussion with stakeholders, we finally decided to provide the Fitness Mirror Service for Home gym. To conduct the system, we built a Smart Mirror App and admin system.</p>
